                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>This project attempts to show the benefits from using a framework like AngularJS, particularly
                        focusing in the use of: Router, directives for HTML injection, services and providers with dependency
                        injection on controllers, MVVM aka two-way-binding and refactoring code into
                        independent components.</p>
                        <h3>Reasons</h3>
                        <dt>Router:</dt>
                        <dd>Why depending directly on HTML files when you can resolve URIs assigned to HTML templates
                        and JS controllers? Also, why having to loose state or ability to share data between pages,
                        relying on a backend, when you can just NOT reload anything but the view and keep data shared
                        between them?</dd>
                        <dt>HTML directives:</dt>
                        <dd>Why repeating code so many times in each view if you can just write it once and import
                        it with an HTML tag?</dd>
                        <dt>Services/Providers:</dt>
                        <dd>Why having your view-model sharing the same space as your business logic?</dd>
                        <dt>MVVM:</dt>
                        <dd>Why using jQuery to get user input and show outputs when you can easily use Angular's
                        $scope model magic and keep the code readable, maintainable and extensible?</dd>
                        <dt>Refactor:</dt>
                        <dd>Why having large JS files with a full page's functionality when you can have it split
                        into simple self-sufficient components?</dd>
